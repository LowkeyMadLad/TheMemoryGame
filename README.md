This was a project proposal put forth by the group to create a memory based game using the PIC microcontroller architecture in which you could select a difficulty using an analogue potentiometer and then the game would flash a series of 3 lights that would have to be guessed in order to complete the level. The lights progressively get faster until you failed to guess the combination if 3 lights, or the minimum blink time of 25ms was reached (the equivalent of approximately 2 frames at 60FPS). 

This requires several components such as:
- An active terminal link via UART2
- A breadboard configuration with a PIC24F16KA101 micro controller
- 3 buttons and lights hooked up based on the code in IOs.c file
- A Potentiometer
